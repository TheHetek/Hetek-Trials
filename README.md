NEWS (Dec 3rd 2025)
Why there are no updates?
I have decided to discontinue Hetek Trials. This game was my first video game, and because of this, it has some major flaws that need to be adressed.

What's next?
The game is going to be remade under a new name - Nano Temple Trials. (Decided to remove my nickname from my projects, it's too corny anyway)
Some stuff from v0.4.0 is going to be transferred to the new game, but most assets will be tweaked/remade to separate the new game from Hetek Trials.

What's gonna happen with this game?
I'm gonna leave the repository here, even after Nano Temple Trials releases.

When is Nano Temple Trials going to release?
I don't know yet. As of the day of writing this, I'm starting its development.

--- DESCRIPTION OF HETEK TRIALS ---
A simple, yet quite interesting platformer, which is also my true first video game. All of the pixelart was designed by myself.

As of now, the newest version is v0.3.2, which finally included most of the GUI.
In v0.4 versions, I'm planning to add new levels, that will expand upon existing levels.

The game is still in development, major and minor changes happen very often.
Feel free to share your feedback and suggestions, because still most elements of the game are subject to change.

Main purpose of this repository is to keep all versions here, so I don't have to upload them to every single person.
