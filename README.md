A simple, yet quite interesting platformer, which is also my true first video game. All of the pixelart was designed by myself.

As of now, the newest version is v0.3.2, which finally included most of the GUI.
In v0.4 versions, I'm planning to add 5 new levels, that will share similar traits to the existing ones.

In v0.5 versions, there will be a 2nd "chapter", which is gonna include a new environment, new blocks and new features.

The game is still in development, major and minor changes happen very often.
Feel free to share your feedback and suggestions, because still most elements of the game are subject to change.

Main purpose of this repository is to keep all versions here, so I don't have to upload them to every single person.
