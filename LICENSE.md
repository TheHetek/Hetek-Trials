Please do not: 
- redistribute the game, in changed or unchanged form, without my permission. (except if it's personal-use only)
- take my assets and share them without my permission. (except if it's personal-use only)
- if you do mod the game, keep it personal-use only and be sure to clarify it's a mod of my game.

I know it sounds arrogant and egotistic, but this is my first ever game, and I want to learn some stuff for myself. I may change that someday though.
