Please do not: 
- redistribute the game, in changed or unchanged form, without my permission.
- take my assets and use them outside my game.
- don't mod my game.

I know it sounds arrogant and egotistic, but this is my first ever game, and I want to learn some stuff for myself. I may change that someday though.
